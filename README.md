- **quiz_brain.py**: The brain behind the quiz. It manages the questions, checks your answers, and keeps your score.

- **data.py**: This file contains the set of True/False questions. You can add more questions or modify the existing ones here.

## Example Questions

Here are a few example questions you might encounter in the quiz:

- "A slug's blood is green." (Answer: True)
